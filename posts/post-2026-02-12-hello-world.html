                <h2>The blog has been revived.</h2>
                <p>It has been a while since I at least tried to be more active in the community. Reviving this blog should be the first step into more frequent posting and pushing myself to actively work on cybersecurity related topics.</p>

                <p>One topic besides offensive security tradecraft, threat intelligence and adversary hunting, is to help people getting into cybersecurity and help them to find their way to a job they really enjoy.</p>

                <p>Networking is key and therefore I can't emphasise enough to join our Discord community around our CTF team called purplestorm. We are an open cybersecurity community for everyone, built around CTF platforms like Hack The Box and Vulnlab. From beginners to people who have been working in cybersecurity for years, everyone is welcome. If you're looking for people to play CTFs with, improve your skills, exchange knowledge, and learn together with others who share the same passion for cybersecurity, you are more than welcome to join us.</p>

                <p>Feel free to get in touch and stay tuned. I will do my best to give something back to the community which helped me so much through all the years <3</p>

                <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
